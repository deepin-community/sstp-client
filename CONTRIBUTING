Signoff
-------

In order to forestall possible (though unlikely) future legal problems, 
this project requires a "Signed-off-by" line on all non-trivial patches, 
with a real name (not just initials, and no pseudonyms).  

Signing off indicates that you certify that your patch meets the 
'Developer's Certificate of Origin' below (taken from the DCO 1.1 in the 
Linux kernel source tree).
